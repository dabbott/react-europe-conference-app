Meanwhile, libraries like RxJS and Mobx are spreading the use of Reactive Programming to model UIs via discrete, asynchronous event streams. How can we combine the best of both functional and reactive paradigms to model and build predictable UIs that control themselves?\n\nIn this talk, Preethi will explain what “Functional Reactive Programming” is, how close React / Redux / Mobx / RxJs and others come in realizing Functional Reactive Programming, and what's still fundamentally missing from these tools to achieve a true implementation of FRP. Lastly, she'll describe when and why  FRP is suitable (or not suitable) for building predictable and scalable UIs.",

It can aid and reinforce spatial maps of our interfaces, and give us a sense that we understand interactions more deeply. For this reason, animation is incredibly powerful to convey meaning, but only when done well.\n\nBut animating the virtual DOM comes with some intricacies that affect our implementations. In this talk, we'll go over animating in React with a variety of methods, comparing and contrasting each. We'll cover add-ons like ReactCSSTransitionGroup, using external libraries like GSAP, React-Motion, motion using RxJS, and transitioning state with D3. We'll look inside some real systems, breaking down how we can create reusable components of animation principles for interchangeable yet cohesive patterns.",
